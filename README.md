# Particle Mass Flash

A Bootstrap/jQuery driven interface for bulk flashing a single firmware to multiple Particle.io devices. Specifically, a user can supply a .json file with device ID/access token pairs and a firmware binary file. The firmware binary will be pushed to all devices in the .json file via the Particle.io REST API.
